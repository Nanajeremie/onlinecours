                    Maxime Bako is an IT engineer and believes that programming allows us to create something out of nothing. When programming we are not limited to physical constraints; if you can imagine it, you can crate it with enough thought and effort. the idea of developping software that can intervene in several areas such as education, management, health, agriculture, livestock and other is fascinating. Being able to contribute to the improvement of the important areas for Burkina Fasoâ€™s development is a great motivation and the computer programming problems and challenges, constant learning, and satisfaction that come from programming make him love it.
